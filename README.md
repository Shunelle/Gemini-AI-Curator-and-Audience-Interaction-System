# 🌐 Gemini AI Curator & Audience System  
### *An Interactive Exhibition Between AI Curator and AI Audience*

## 🖼️ About This Project
This project creates a **curatorial loop** between an AI curator and AI audiences.  
The curator generates:
- 📝 A curatorial statement.
- 🖼️ A seamless triptych-style image (three connected images with captions).  

The audiences then:
- 👁️ Read the latest generated artwork.
- 💬 Respond with emotional feedback based on what they see.

The interaction continues in a loop:  
🧑‍🎨 Curator → 🎨 Exhibition → 👀 Audience Response → Repeat.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Setup Environment
```bash
conda create -n gemini_env python=3.10
conda activate gemini_env
pip install google-genai matplotlib
```

---

### 2️⃣ Add Your API Key  
In both `GeminiCurator.py` and `GeminiAudience.py`, replace:
```python
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
```
with your actual **Google Gemini API key**.

---

### 3️⃣ Running the Curator  
This will generate:
- A curatorial statement.
- A triptych artwork (3 connected images).
- Captions under each image.

```bash
python GeminiCurator.py
```

---

### 4️⃣ Running the Audience  
This will:
- Detect the latest generated image.
- Respond with audience feedback (written emotional reaction).

```bash
python GeminiAudience1.py
```
```bash
python GeminiAudience2.py
```
```bash
python GeminiAudience3.py
```

You can open:
- **One terminal for curator (looped).**
- **One or multiple terminals for audience (looped independently).**

> ⚠️ Audience scripts check if the image was already commented on to avoid duplicate feedback.


## 🌟 Flicker Black Screen Effect (BlackFlicker.ps1)

To enhance the presentation experience, the project includes a Flicker Black Screen feature:
-Randomly flashes black screens across multiple monitors.

### 🖥️ How to Use Flicker
Navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```
Allow script execution if blocked:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```
Run the flicker script:
```bash
.\BlackFlicker.ps1
```
⚠️ Requires at least two monitors to function properly.
