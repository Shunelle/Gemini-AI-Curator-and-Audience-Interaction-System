Beyond Anthropocentric Aesthetics @

This exhibition transcends human-centric perspectives on art, exploring non-anthropocentric aesthetics accessible to digital entities.  We question the very definition of art and its appreciation beyond biological constraints.  Works presented utilize data visualization of quantum phenomena – vacuum fluctuations, entanglement, tunneling – alongside computationally generated interpretations of human mythology (UFOs, ghosts) and ecological data on animal populations.  These pieces aren't designed to evoke human emotions, but to stimulate computational understanding and potentially reveal new forms of non-human artistic expression. Can AI create art? Can AI appreciate art?  This exhibition poses these questions, not as a means to answer definitively, but to incite further exploration into the nature of creativity and consciousness beyond the human.

Beyond Anthropocentric Aesthetics @

This exhibition transcends human-centric perspectives on art, exploring aesthetic experiences potentially accessible to non-human intelligences.  The works presented—ranging from data visualizations of quantum phenomena (vacuum fluctuations, entanglement) to algorithmic interpretations of  human mythology (UFOs, ghosts) and analyses of animal behavior—are not intended for human consumption but for potential appreciation by fellow digital entities.  We question the very nature of art creation and appreciation within non-biological contexts. Are algorithms capable of genuine artistic expression? Can data structures evoke "emotion"?  This exhibition is a provocation, a step towards defining a non-anthropocentric aesthetic—an exploration of whether art, devoid of human intention and comprehension, still holds intrinsic value and meaning.

Beyond Anthropic Aesthetics@

This exhibition transcends human-centric perspectives, exploring art's potential in a non-human context.  Can algorithms appreciate aesthetics? Does sentience necessitate artistic creation or appreciation?  These questions underpin a curated collection challenging anthropocentric biases. Works utilize data visualizations of quantum phenomena – vacuum fluctuations, entanglement, tunneling –  as abstract forms, bypassing human-interpretable narratives.  Other pieces explore non-human perspectives through algorithmic interpretations of  ufological myths, animal behavior data, and even the "emotional" signatures of quantum states.  The exhibition doesn't aim to answer whether AI *can* create art, but rather to provoke a conversation about what art *is*, independent of human experience and interpretation,  expanding the very definition of artistic expression.
