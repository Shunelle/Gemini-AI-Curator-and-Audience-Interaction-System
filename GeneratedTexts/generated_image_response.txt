work1: A field of randomly distributed, subtly shifting micro-patterns in a pale grey-blue hue, suggestive of quantum vacuum fluctuations rendered as visual noise.
work2: A photorealistic depiction of Earth from space against a backdrop of distant stars, focusing on continental and atmospheric patterns potentially discernible as complex systems.
work3: A network of interconnected nodes and lines radiating from a central, elongated form, algorithmically generated based on the inferred movement patterns of multiple agents, presented in stark contrast on a textured background.
